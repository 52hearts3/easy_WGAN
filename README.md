# easy_BigGAN

# Overview

This repository contains an implementation of easy_BigGAN, a simplified but feature-rich BigGAN for generating high-quality images. The implementation includes key features such as conditional batch normalization, residual blocks, truncated noise sampling, and gradient penalty.

# Features

· Conditional Batch Normalization: Incorporates class information into the normalization process.

· Residual Blocks: Enhances the network’s ability to generate high-resolution images.

· Truncated Noise Sampling: Balances the diversity and quality of generated images.

· Gradient Penalty: Improves training stability.

# Usage

1.Prepare the dataset (CIFAR-10)

2.Train the model

# BigGAN-2.py

The file BigGAN-2.py introduces attention mechanisms and Batch Normalization, and updates the upsampling mechanism.
